        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Interpreted Languages\n",
        "    - Code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",
        "    - No separate compilation step; the program runs directly from source code.\n",
        "    - Slower execution since each line is translated on the fly.\n",
        "    - More flexible for debugging and platform independence.\n",
        "    - Examples: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compiled Languages\n",
        "    - Code is translated entirely into machine code before execution.\n",
        "    - Requires a compiler to generate an executable file.\n",
        "    - Faster execution since the program runs as machine code directly.\n",
        "    - More optimized but less flexible for quick edits and testing.\n",
        "    - Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors so that the program doesn’t crash. It uses a `try` block to run code that might cause an error, and an `except` block to handle the error if it happens. For example, if you try to divide by zero, Python will normally crash, but with exception handling, you can show a friendly message instead. You can also handle different types of errors separately, use `else` to run code if no errors happen, and `finally` to run code no matter what (like closing a file). This makes programs more reliable and user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block in exception handling is used to run code no matter what happens, whether an error occurs or not. It is useful for tasks that need to be done at the end, like closing a file, releasing resources, or cleaning up memory. Even if an error happens in the try block or if there is a return statement in try or except, the finally block will always execute. This ensures that important cleanup tasks are completed, making the program more reliable and preventing resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging in Python is a way to track events and errors in a program. Instead of using print() statements for debugging, logging allows you to record messages with different levels like info, warning, error, and critical. This helps in monitoring the program, finding issues, and keeping logs for future analysis. Python provides a built-in logging module, which lets you save logs to a file or display them on the console. Logging is useful for debugging, tracking user activity, and handling errors in a professional way.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "- The `__del__` method in Python is a destructor that is called automatically when an object is about to be deleted. It is used to clean up resources, such as closing files or network connections, before the object is removed from memory. However, Python has automatic garbage collection, so __del__ is rarely needed. Using it incorrectly can cause issues, like delaying object deletion if there are circular references. Instead, it's better to use context managers (with statement) or the finally block for resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- importer\n",
        " - The import statement in Python is used to bring an entire module into a program. When using import, you must reference the module name before accessing its functions or variables. This approach helps in avoiding name conflicts and makes it clear where each function comes from\n",
        "- from ... import\n",
        " - The from ... import statement allows you to import specific functions or variables directly, so you don’t need to reference the module name. This makes the code shorter and more readable, especially when working with frequently used functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- You can handle multiple exceptions using a `try-except` block with multiple `except` statements or by using a tuple of exception types.\n",
